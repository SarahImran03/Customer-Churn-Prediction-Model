# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
This is a model to predict whether a customer for a call service would churn or not.
I have used the common Machine Learning libraries of python for this.
The libraries are Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib (for various graphs).
I used the Logistic Regression model to predict.
